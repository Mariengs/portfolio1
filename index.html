            <h2>HTML&CSS</h2>
            <p>
              This was my first HTML&CSS project. This assignment required
              creating a fully functional, responsive website based on a design
              brief. The website needed to include all pages from the site
              architecture, using semantic HTML and well-structured CSS,
              adhering to the DRY principle. It should be accessible, WCAG
              compliant, and responsive across all screen sizes without
              horizontal scrollbars. Flexbox and CSS Grid were to be used where
              suitable, and JavaScript functionality could be simulated. The
              project also required unique metadata for each page and original
              code written by the student

            <h2>Semester Project 1</h2>
            <p>
              This project involved designing and building a modern, responsive
              website for the Community Science Museum, targeting primary and
              middle school children and families. The site needed to be
              engaging and accessible, without being overly childish. It had to
              include pages such as a home page, contact page, exhibitions,
              contribution information, privacy policy, and terms and
              conditions. The website had to be fully responsive, cross-browser
              compatible, and accessible to users with impairments. It was built
              using semantic HTML, adhering to the CSS DRY principle, and with
              no use of frameworks or JavaScript.

            <h2>Project Exam 1</h2>
            <p>
              This project involved building a front-end interface for an
              API-based blogging application. The website needed to be
              responsive and allow users to view dynamic blog posts, with
              features like a carousel for the latest posts and clickable
              thumbnails. For the owner (admin), there were pages for logging
              in, registering, and managing blog posts (including editing and
              deleting posts). The application had to use HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript, with no CSS or JS frameworks allowed. The site
              required integration with an API to fetch and manage blog data,
              and had to be properly validated for both user and owner
              interactions.
