Develop a Portfolio Webpage:

List the three projects as cards.

Each card must include:
Title of the project OK 
Description
Screenshot of the running project OK 
Links to the GitHub repo and live site OK  (if applicable)

Ensure the webpage looks professional, is responsive,
 and is hosted (preferably on GitHub Pages or Netlify).
